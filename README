HERNicecastHelper is something I have been working on in my spare time to extend functionality to Nicecast (www.rogueamoeba.net), a really
awesome Shoutcast client for Mac OS X. There were a couple of features that we needed to add at the radio station, so I built another 
application to interface w/ Nicecast in a way that DJ's could easily understand. The basic needs that the HERNicecastHelper fulfills:

1. Allows DJ's who want to play analog recordings to still comply with the DMCA and send "track titles" while streaming. DJ's can switch to 
an easy hand-type track title solution by the simple click of a button. While in this mode, Nicecast will pull titles from HERNicecastHelper (more
specifically, a file that HERNicecastHelper creates in the Library/Application Support dir). When a DJ is done using manual track titles, they quickly
switch back to having titles pulled from iTunes. 

2. Allow DJ's to switch to the 'Off Hours' server. At Hollow Earth Radio, we are moving to using a linux/icecast solution for our Off Hours (non live dj)
hours, and we wanted to make this switch to the automated server easy for DJ's. As of the latest version of this software, DJ's should be able to click a 
button to 'switch to off hours' and HERNicecastHelper will run a ruby script at 30 second intervals to pull the track titles out of an internal icecast/airtime server. 
In a future version, clicking the 'off hours' button will also automatically set iTunes to a playlist file that is just a stream of the icecast/airtime broadcast and relay
that audio signal. For now, DJ's will have to click on the playlist themselves until this has been scripted. 

## Other Release Notes ##

* You are free to use any of this you want if it's at all helpful to you. Use at your own risk and stuff.
  But please let me know if you have any issues, most of this was written on a time crunch. 

* One hacky thing I had to do is 'stop' and 'start' the broadcast when switching between any of the modes, because of a limitation of Nicecast. Changing the 
  track titles source can only happen when you are not broadcasting, so I call some applescript to stop/start which I believe has neglible impact on the stream. 
  It does interfere with archiving, so be advised.
